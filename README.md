# SOC-Portfolio
I am a Cyber Security student building a practical portfolio with a focus on SOC Analyst and Blue Team roles.

This repository demonstrates my understanding of blue team fundamentals, including alert triage, log analysis, incident investigation, and response processes when security anomalies occur.

The portfolio contains hands-on labs, investigation write-ups, and playbooks based on TryHackMe exercises and independent self-study, with an emphasis on SOC Tier 1 responsibilities and structured thinking.
